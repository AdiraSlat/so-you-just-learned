# [Step 0: Please hold your questions until the end of Step 1.](#step0)

You’re learning new things and you might want to jump in with both feet. *We get it!* 

But some of your friends who have already been here a while might not have the same level of energy. And they really won’t appreciate it if you ask a bunch of questions that are easily Google-able. 

It’s important to protect the *Emotional Labor* of your [marginalized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_exclusion) friends. They don’t want to be your teacher, they want to engage in discussion with you. But you have to do some up front work to get on their level.

Take a deep breath, have Google opened in a new tab, learn to take really good notes, and get ready for step one.

# [Step 1: Educate Yourself](#step1)

That’s right, we said educate *yourself*. We’re not going to do it for you.

### [Women of Color](#woc)

*Note: women of color deserve a separate category because of the complications of inhabiting intersectional identities and encountering overlapping bias.*

**[Not a Black Chair](https://medium.com/@amelielamont/not-a-black-chair-8a8e7e2b9140)** - One woman’s story of racism, sexism, and discrimination at Squarespace.

### Gender

**["Females" in Open Source](https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/females-in-open-source)** - "Events being ‘open to everyone’ was a token political statement. If they didn’t recognize someone as being part of their in-group, all they had to do was make them uncomfortable. After all, that person is always ‘free’ to leave."

**[Reflecting On One Very, Very Strange Year At Uber](https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2017/2/19/reflecting-on-one-very-strange-year-at-uber)** - Possibly the most euphamistic title I’ve ever seen of one of these accounts. Sexism and racism are rampant at Uber. Who knew?

**[The Ping Pong Theory of Tech World Sexism](https://medium.com/matter/the-ping-pong-theory-of-tech-world-sexism-c2053c10c06c)** - Explaining tech world sexism in comic strip form.

**[I Need Terrible Female Engineers](https://medium.com/@amyngyn/i-need-terrible-female-engineers-1023a2e973dd#.x6teafgwf)** - Why it’s exhausting that there are so many exemplary women. Stereotype threat and the pervasive myth of the "exceptional woman" in tech create a barrier that makes women believe they are never good enough. The same could be applied to the “exceptional minority” stereotype that exists in the tech industry.

### Race

**[Q&A With the Black Twitter Engineer Who Left Over Diversity Problems](http://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2015/11/06/454949422/a-q-a-with-lesley-miley-the-black-twitter-engineer-who-left-over-diversity-probl)** - What it says on the tin :)

### General

**[The Other Side of Diversity](https://medium.com/this-is-hard/the-other-side-of-diversity-1bb3de2f053e)** - "I don’t need to change to fit within my industry. My industry needs to change to make everyone feel included and accepted."

**[When Excellence Isn't Enough](https://medium.com/thelist/when-excellence-isnt-enough-79643e226c6a)** - "No matter how bad it is to talk about, ignoring it is worse."

**[A Hacking Hiatus](https://medium.com/hackers-and-hacking/a-hacking-hiatus-4844ae073d4)**  - "I’ve felt increasingly uncomfortable and often downright disrespected within a community that I helped build.“

# [Step 2: Do Something About It](#step-2)

Knowing that there are problems isn’t enough. Pick an organization that helps to improve the tech industry and donate your money or time.

She sent me to a therapist.](http://www.vox.com/first-person/2017/2/20/14617778/woman-no-kids-sterilization)** - Women are *still* treated like they don’t know what’s good for themselves. Their mental health is often questioned if they vocalize not wanting to become parents and instead focus on their careers. Or worse, they’re told they might be failures to their husbands’ expectations if they choose to remain childless. Here is one woman’s story.
